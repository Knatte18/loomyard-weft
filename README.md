Prime owner: `neve`.

Tasks are grouped by dependency layer and notes by type.
An entry waits only on the open entries it names under After, so the entries in one layer can run in parallel.

## [P1 Fewer agent turns, fewer tokens](project-turn-savings.md) (7)

`turn-savings` · Age 55m · Owner `neve`

Token savings by cutting agent turns, above all late turns at large context

### Tasks (4)

Concrete and claimable; only a task can run.

#### Running (3)

Held by a run; its scope is locked until the run ends.

| # | Task | Slug | Recipe | At | Owner | Age<br>Revised | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T3 | **Agents may use subagents and forks; only headless claude -p stays refused**<br>• Remove the Agent tool deny, refuse headless claude -p launches instead, and tell writers when to hand work to Sonnet subagents | [`darn-sonnet-helpers`](design-darn-sonnet-helpers.md) | darn | Finalize | neve | 1h<br>41m | claude, shuttle, stencil |
| T4 | **Shorten the plan spec and split it into sub-files read by need**<br>• loom-plan-spec.md is 112 KB, half of it a catalogue of validation checks; cut it down and split it so each role reads only what it uses | [`plan-spec-split`](design-plan-spec-split.md) | darn | Finalize | neve | 1h<br>35m | loom, stencil, webster |
| T11 | **tokencount counts darn runs and compares recipes**<br>• Count darns with their own segments, so a darn's cost stands beside a tapestry's | [`tokencount-darn-runs`](design-tokencount-darn-runs.md) | darn | Darn-Write | neve | 4h<br>20m | tools |

#### Ready (0)

Waits on nothing open; can start now.

_None._

| T5 | `draft` **One cold, cheap fixer clears a failed writer gate instead of the writer at full context**<br>• When the Darn-Write, plan, discussion or Webster card gate fails, Go spawns one shared cold fixer with the gate report, generalised from webster fix-verify<br>• `profile: light` | [`cold-gate-fixer`](design-cold-gate-fixer.md) | tapestry | T4 | 50m<br>27m | webster, loom, darn, gate |

| R2 |  | **Plan and Discussion writers explore through parallel Sonnet agents that return only what is relevant**<br>• Plan-Write and Discussion-Write start parallel cold-start explore agents that return a list of relevant files and facts; the writer reads only those and writes; encouraged, not commanded; bench guidance against none | [`planner-fork-lookups`](design-planner-fork-lookups.md) | 50m<br>8m | loom |

| E7 |  | **A hook nudges an agent back to batching the moment it breaks the rule**<br>• Above about 150k context agents drift into grep-then-slice chains and one-fix-per-turn edits, about a third of context tokens in a 28-session sample; a PostToolUse hook adds one line on a breach, with sharper rule wording | [`batching-breach-nudge`](design-batching-breach-nudge.md) | 1h<br>55m | claude, shuttle |

| T2 | **Reed loses the Parts-Plan-Write chair strand while its part writers run**<br>• The chair vanished from reed, then the row failed on two missed liveness checks | [`reed-loses-parts-chair`](design-reed-loses-parts-chair.md) | darn | Code-Burler-Fix | neve | 1h<br>25m | reed, loom |
| T6 | **lym config --set cannot write a key inside a nested map, such as a gate tier env**<br>• An orch cannot change a gate tier env or command without an interactive editor | [`config-set-nested-keys`](design-config-set-nested-keys.md) | darn | Darn-Write | neve | 1h<br>24m | config, gate |
| T7 | **Dobby reports a healthy run idle in the seconds after its agent session ends**<br>• The no-agent idle clock falls back to the row start in the gap between the session ending and the row writing its history | [`dobby-idle-notice-row-end`](design-dobby-idle-notice-row-end.md) | darn | Finalize | neve | 6h<br>24m | dobby, shuttle |
| T8 | **batten cancel hangs on a step held by its own pause, and --remove fails on removed records**<br>• A cancel during Open-IDE deadlocks with the step waiting on the cancel's pause; cancel --remove errors when the records are already gone | [`cancel-hangs-on-own-pause`](design-cancel-hangs-on-own-pause.md) | darn | Darn-Write | neve | 34m<br>24m | batten |

| R6 |  | **Plan writer cost: sub-planners per part, and twill versus a solo writer**<br>• The Plan writer is 18% of spend; sub-planners per part for large bundles, and a twill versus solo Opus high comparison on cost, rounds and time | [`plan-writer-context`](design-plan-writer-context.md) | 10d<br>1h | loom, stencil |

#### Enhancements (12)

| # | Prio | Note | Slug | Age<br>Revised | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E2 |  | **Codex CLI as a second shuttle engine: codexengine**<br>• codexengine for single-session roles, built from the 2026-10-24 spike report and claudeengine list of needs | [`codex-engine`](design-codex-engine.md) | 4w<br>2h | shuttle, codex |
| E3 |  | **A run keeps the lym binary and Bolt instructions it started with** | [`run-pins-its-version`](design-run-pins-its-version.md) | 5d<br>7h | batten, stencil, config |
| E4 |  | **Prove the dotnet scoper, shared build and Drift on the C# sandbox hub**<br>• Switch the sandbox gate to scoper dotnet, a build step and --no-build, then enable Drift there | [`sandbox-dotnet-gate`](design-sandbox-dotnet-gate.md) | 3d<br>3d | dotnet, gate |
| E5 |  | **A landing notice is not lost when set late, when dobby was down, or when the orch is absent**<br>• Close the known limits landing-watch left: a late notify_on_land, a Land passed while dobby was down, and a dropped line when no orch is live | [`landing-watch-limits`](design-landing-watch-limits.md) | 11h<br>11h | dobby, orch |
| E6 |  | **A task with no recipe runs darn, not tapestry**<br>• The default recipe becomes darn, set in board.yaml, so a small task promoted without a recipe does not start a full tapestry run | [`default-recipe-darn`](design-default-recipe-darn.md) | 34m<br>34m | board, batten |
| E9 |  | **An idle interactive run saves its work and pauses, to go on another time**<br>• lym asks an idle interactive agent to commit what it has and end, and the run resumes later | [`interactive-idle-park`](design-interactive-idle-park.md) | 1d<br>12h | shed, shuttle, batten |
| E10 |  | **The hibernate request is carried by dobby, not a daemon of its own**<br>• Move lym hibernate request into dobby; the past-Land test is already shared | [`hibernate-in-dobby`](design-hibernate-in-dobby.md) | 1d<br>1d | dobby |
| E11 |  | **Merge in from parent as a task of its own in a beam, before pawl lands it**<br>• A command on a beam files a merge-in-from-parent task, run as darn with its perch on | [`parent-merge-task`](design-parent-merge-task.md) | 1d<br>8h | pawl, workspaces, drift, landing |
| E12 |  | **Comment cleanup: parallel agents fix stale comments across the repository**<br>• An orchestrating agent hands each package to a worker, possibly Haiku 5.5, that fixes comments no longer true or pinning perishable specifics | [`comment-cleanup`](design-comment-cleanup.md) | 1d<br>7h | fabric |
| E19 |  | **Every remote operation runs async, and local-only fabric pairs stay an explicit choice only**<br>• Remote work goes async except the branch-exists check; batch pairs reach origin like any pair, and the local-only mode stays only as an explicit --local until a use is found or it is removed | [`fabric-remote-async`](design-fabric-remote-async.md) | 2w<br>5d | fabric, batten |
| E20 |  | **Plan and Discussion fixers on Sonnet, once findings are concrete enough**<br>• Webster and Merge fixers are already Sonnet; Plan and Discussion fixers need concrete findings first | [`fixers-on-sonnet`](design-fixers-on-sonnet.md) | 10d<br>4d | burler, claude |
| E24 |  | **A status-bar button asks for a value, so an agent opened from it gets a name**<br>• Button entries take ask, filling {answer}; the agent button asks for the strand name, and term becomes terminal | [`button-ask-name`](design-button-ask-name.md) | 4h<br>4h | reed, config |

#### Features (14)

| # | Prio | Note | Slug | Age<br>Revised | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1 |  | **Hardener: an autonomous behavior-review campaign that replaces crucible**<br>• Parked by the operator: settle the Tenter/Hardener design and build the campaign that runs a live-substrate module in a sandbox until it converges | [`hardener`](design-hardener.md) | 4w<br>5d | burler |
| F2 |  | **A status-bar button opens a short-lived board agent, so board talks need no orch**<br>• An ordinary agent with a board-policy skill loaded, for discussing and filing notes and releasing tasks on go-ahead | [`board-agent-button`](design-board-agent-button.md) | 1d<br>4h | reed, board, shuttle, orch |
| F3 | L | **A module overlap lets a task run Discussion at once and wait only before Plan**<br>• A second kind of dependency, plan_after: the task starts and discusses, then waits before Plan until the named tasks have landed | [`plan-after-dependency`](design-plan-after-dependency.md) | 6h<br>6h | board, batten, loom |
| F4 |  | **The orch lies dormant and wakes only when a run needs help**<br>• Dobby takes the mechanics and a spawned agent the doubtful cases; one orch per beam lives on, dormant, woken when needed | [`dormant-orch`](design-dormant-orch.md) | 1d<br>23h | orch, dobby, arbiter |
| F5 |  | **Fabric's ordinary-monorepo verb surface**<br>• Against plain git, fabric still lacks log, show, branch, tag, stash, revert, restore, rm/mv, rebase, cherry-pick and blame | [`fabric-monorepo-verbs`](design-fabric-monorepo-verbs.md) | 4w<br>3w | fabric |
| F6 |  | **Talk to the orch through Slack**<br>• A Slack relay so the operator can reach the orch from a phone where Claude's own app is not allowed | [`reed-slack-relay`](design-reed-slack-relay.md) | 4w<br> | reed |
| F7 |  | **Creel mail between hubs through an inbox folder, with a verified sender**<br>• A shared inbox folder takes mail from other hubs; each file names the sender hub and agent so a reply knows where to go | [`creel-cross-hub-mail`](design-creel-cross-hub-mail.md) | 2d<br>2d | creel, orch |
| F8 |  | **fabric: two-sided reset-to-SHA verb**<br>• The post-conclude undo the merge surface does not ship: reset to a warp SHA, resolve the paired weft SHA through the correspondence index, gate both sides | [`fabric-reset-to-sha`](design-fabric-reset-to-sha.md) | 4w<br>3w | fabric |
| F9 |  | **A closed area for lym: bwrap sandbox in stages, off by default**<br>• Run the lym process tree in a bwrap area with a host proxy and broker, built in three stages with a stop; to be split if it goes ahead | [`sandbox-closed-area-build`](design-sandbox-closed-area-build.md) | 2d<br>2d | reed, shuttle, claude, fabric, creel, dobby, batten, deploy, config, ide |
| F10 |  | **The arbiter settles review escalations and records their decisions, so they never reach the orch**<br>• Decision escalations become eligible for the arbiter, and the arbiter may record decisions and accept or continue a review | [`arbiter-settles-escalations`](design-arbiter-settles-escalations.md) | 6h<br>6h | burler, arbiter, dobby, orch |
| F11 |  | **Interactive board view: a regenerated HTML file and a phone-friendly README**<br>• board.html rendered with README on every write; a VS Code task opens it in the browser; collapsible README for the GitHub app | [`board-viewer`](design-board-viewer.md) | 4w<br>1h | board, ide, orch |
| F13 | L | **Weaver: a cold-start implementer beside Webster, with model escalation**<br>• A second implementer built on Millhouse Builder: a fresh agent per batch with its own model, escalating the model when an agent fails; Webster stays fork-based | [`weaver`](design-weaver.md) | 3w<br>20m | webster |
| F14 |  | **The decision record on the board, and splitting a discussed task**<br>• A task flagged discussed carries its decision record on the board and skips Discussion; three ways to split, from by hand to stitch | [`discussed-task-split`](design-discussed-task-split.md) | 10d<br>7h | loom, board, batten, workspaces |
| F17 |  | **Ideas to borrow from comparable agent orchestrators (survey, Oct 2026)** | [`orchestrator-survey-ideas`](design-orchestrator-survey-ideas.md) | 2w<br>4d | burler, shed, orch, quarry, report |
