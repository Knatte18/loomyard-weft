# Board

Rendered 2026-11-08 08:22 UTC; every age below is as of then.
Prime owner: `neve`.

Tasks are grouped by dependency layer and notes by type.
An entry waits only on the open entries it names under After, so the entries in one layer can run in parallel.

| R2 |  | **Re-measure writer exploration and the carry of lookup results after the Discussion stencil change**<br>• Re-run the writer-lookups measurement on 10 tapestry runs, pricing the carry saved by early explore subagents | [`writer-lookups-remeasure`](design-writer-lookups-remeasure.md) | 3d<br>2d | loom, stencil |
| R6 |  | **Plan writer cost: sub-planners per part, and twill versus a solo writer**<br>• The Plan writer is 18% of spend; sub-planners per part for large bundles, and a twill versus solo Opus high comparison on cost, rounds and time | [`plan-writer-context`](design-plan-writer-context.md) | 2w<br>2d | loom, stencil |
| R7 |  | **Re-measure the batching hook once its transcript wait has landed**<br>• Count firings against edit follows and lookup chains again, now that the hook waits for its call to reach the transcript | [`batching-hook-remeasure-wait`](design-batching-hook-remeasure-wait.md) | 20h<br>20h | claude, shuttle |

| F1 |  | **Hardener: an autonomous behavior-review campaign that replaces crucible**<br>• Parked by the operator: settle the Tenter/Hardener design and build the campaign that runs a live-substrate module in a sandbox until it converges | [`hardener`](design-hardener.md) | 5w<br>11d | burler |
| F2 |  | **Slack presence follows where the operator writes, with a reed toggle**<br>• lym switches presence on an operator Slack message or pane line, tells operator lines from its own injects, and shows a slack on/off toggle in reed | [`slack-presence-auto`](design-slack-presence-auto.md) | 2d<br>2d | reed, shuttle |
| F9 |  | **A closed area for lym: bwrap sandbox in stages, off by default**<br>• Run the lym process tree in a bwrap area with a host proxy and broker, built in three stages with a stop; to be split if it goes ahead | [`sandbox-closed-area-build`](design-sandbox-closed-area-build.md) | 8d<br>2d | reed, shuttle, claude, fabric, creel, dobby, batten, deploy, config, ide |

| F12 |  | **Two Claude accounts, each worktree on one of them by a configured weight**<br>• A claude config lists accounts with a config directory, a weight and their limit windows; a worktree picks one at its first session by weight and current headroom | [`claude-account-weights`](design-claude-account-weights.md) | 5d<br>15h | claude, shuttle, config |
| F13 | L | **Weaver: a cold-start implementer beside Webster, with model escalation**<br>• A second implementer built on Millhouse Builder: a fresh agent per batch with its own model, escalating the model when an agent fails; Webster stays fork-based | [`weaver`](design-weaver.md) | 4w<br>2d | webster |
| F14 |  | **The decision record on the board, and splitting a discussed task**<br>• A task flagged discussed carries its decision record on the board and skips Discussion; three ways to split, from by hand to stitch | [`discussed-task-split`](design-discussed-task-split.md) | 2w<br>15h | loom, board, batten, workspaces |
