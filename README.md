Prime owner: `osl-1046`.

Tasks are grouped by dependency layer and notes by type.
An entry waits only on the open entries it names under After, so the entries in one layer can run in parallel.

| E3 |  | **Darn-Write gate fix: rerun only the failed tests between attempts**<br>• Each failed verify attempt reruns the full computed scope; a fixer that gets only the failures and reruns only those would save about 10 minutes per attempt. | [`gate-fix-failures-only`](design-gate-fix-failures-only.md) | 5m<br>5m | gate, loom |
