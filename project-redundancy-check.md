Groups the entries filed from the Sketch `redundant-test-finder`: testcover-engine, testmap-verb, testmap-dobby-refresh, gate-redundancy-report, review-reads-redundancy.

Tasks are grouped by dependency layer and notes by type.
An entry waits only on the open entries it names under After, so the entries in one layer can run in parallel.

## Tasks (2)

Concrete and claimable; only a task can run.

### Running (1)

Held by a run; its scope is locked until the run ends.

| # | Task | Slug | Recipe | At | Owner | Age<br>Revised | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Ready (0)

Waits on nothing open; can start now.

_None._

### Layer A (1)

Waits only on Running, Ready or Draft entries.

| # | Task | Slug | Recipe | After | Age<br>Revised | Labels |

## Notes (0)

Not tasks: ideas and observations, merged into a task when one is promoted.
