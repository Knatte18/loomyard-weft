# Card 33 — weight-report-after

**Prosa:**
- `docs/benchmarks/test-suite-weight.md`

**Intent:** The after-state of D3.
The implementer re-runs the three commands of card 4 on the finished tree, leaving out the `llm` tier for card 4's reason, and fills the `## After` section with the same tables per tier, the load averages and the commit, then adds a short `## Comparison` listing, per tier, wall and CPU totals before and after and the `rev-parse` per-subcommand total before and after, read from the census totals, fixture and code summed; the fixture split is reported beside it and never used for the comparison.
A loaded run is noted beside its load average, and the header's regeneration sentence stays, so the operator can repeat the measurement on a quiet machine.
