Cut the turns agents spend on shell edits, piecemeal gate loops and sliced reads, one measured fix at a time

Tasks are grouped by dependency layer and notes by type.
An entry waits only on the open entries it names under After, so the entries in one layer can run in parallel.

## Tasks (2)

Concrete and claimable; only a task can run.

### Running (2)

Held by a run; its scope is locked until the run ends.

| T16 | **The round-1 Plan reviewer gathers in one call a turn**<br>• 1.05 calls a turn and 41% of its weight removable by merging, though it carries the batching sentence | [`plan-reviewer-batching`](design-plan-reviewer-batching.md) | darn | Finalize | neve | 1h<br>1h | burler, stencil |
