# P0 Root: entries under no project

Rendered 2026-11-12 19:38 UTC; every age below is as of then.
Under: [Board](README.md).

Owner `neve`

Tasks are grouped by dependency layer and notes by type.
An entry waits only on the open entries it names under After, so the entries in one layer can run in parallel.

## Tasks (4)

Concrete and claimable; only a task can run.

### Running (1)

Held by a run; its scope is locked until the run ends.

| # | Task | Slug | Recipe | At | Owner | Age<br>Revised | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T3 | **Commit the coverage maps instead of keeping them in .lym**<br>• The maps sit in an excluded .lym directory; the operator wants them checked in, which needs a design for place, size, machines and who commits | [`testmap-checked-in`](design-testmap-checked-in.md) | motif | Discussion-Burler-Review | neve | 33m<br>12m | gate, testkit, dobby |

### Ready (0)

Waits on nothing open; can start now.

_None._

### Draft (3)

Not released; nothing starts it until its status is cleared.

| # | Task | Slug | Recipe | After | Age<br>Revised | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | `draft` **Two Claude accounts, the simple design: a fresh session picks by weight and headroom, a resume finds its transcript**<br>• Revised design of claude-account-weights without a per-worktree record; reuses its decision record and body | [`claude-account-pick-simple`](design-claude-account-pick-simple.md) | motif |  | 10d<br>1d | claude, shuttle, config |
| T2 | `draft` **Measure what coverage-map upkeep costs, check how its state is shown, and write the operator guide**<br>• What the upkeep passes have cost, whether one call shows the maps state, and a short guide to using and keeping the maps | [`testmap-upkeep-cost-and-guide`](design-testmap-upkeep-cost-and-guide.md) | darn · docs |  | 38m<br>38m | gate, testkit, dobby |
| T6 | `draft` **Bench a Sonnet darn writer with an Opus advisor on three landed darn tasks** | [`advisor-model-bench`](design-advisor-model-bench.md) | darn · docs |  | 1d<br>2h | darn, loom, shuttle, claude |

## Notes (12)

Not tasks: ideas and observations, merged into a task when one is promoted.

### Sketches (1)

| # | Prio | Note | Slug | Age<br>Revised | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 |  | **Let orchs on two machines talk through a Slack bridge channel**<br>• A shared Slack channel where each machine's bot posts and reads, with the other machine marked as sender, never as the operator | [`slack-machine-bridge`](design-slack-machine-bridge.md)<br>[Sketch](decision-slack-machine-bridge.md) | 4d<br>23m | slack, creel, orch |

### Research (1)

| # | Prio | Note | Slug | Age<br>Revised | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R3 |  | **Measure what Cortex XDR costs the test suites on OSL-1046**<br>• The 242 s fabricengine tier 1 against 37 to 41 s elsewhere is a machine difference no report has split | [`cortex-cost-measure`](design-cortex-cost-measure.md) | 3d<br>3d | gate, fabric |

### Enhancements (3)

| # | Prio | Note | Slug | Age<br>Revised | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 |  | **A sampler that iterates the rendering of HEDDLE.md until it reads well** | [`heddle-md-readability`](design-heddle-md-readability.md) | 5d<br>5d | heddle |
| E2 |  | **Raddle cuts darn families for size and concurrency**<br>• Fewer, larger darn parts with a short dependency chain, so a family pays fewer fixed costs and runs more parts at once | [`raddle-darn-sizing`](design-raddle-darn-sizing.md) | 4d<br>1d | shed, loom, darn |
| E3 |  | **Narrow the coverage selector's non-body miss by following the names a changed declaration is referenced by** | [`selector-non-body-miss`](design-selector-non-body-miss.md) | 1d<br>1d | testkit, gate |

### Features (7)

| # | Prio | Note | Slug | Age<br>Revised | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1 |  | **Hardener: an autonomous behavior-review campaign that replaces crucible**<br>• Parked by the operator: settle the Tenter/Hardener design and build the campaign that runs a live-substrate module in a sandbox until it converges | [`hardener`](design-hardener.md) | 5w<br>2w | burler |
| F2 |  | **One desktop launcher brings back every hub and beam that was in flight after a crash or reboot**<br>• A lym verb and a .desktop launcher that start each live hub orch and reopen the reed windows | [`machine-restart-shortcut`](design-machine-restart-shortcut.md) | 4d<br>1d | orch, reed, termwindow, shortcut |
| F4 |  | **config: per-machine or per-user branch_prefix, and a review of other per-user keys** | [`per-machine-branch-prefix`](design-per-machine-branch-prefix.md) | 1d<br>1d | config, fabric |
| F9 |  | **A closed area for lym: bwrap sandbox in stages, off by default**<br>• Run the lym process tree in a bwrap area with a host proxy and broker, built in three stages with a stop; to be split if it goes ahead | [`sandbox-closed-area-build`](design-sandbox-closed-area-build.md) | 13d<br>7d | reed, shuttle, claude, fabric, creel, dobby, batten, deploy, config, ide |
| F11 |  | **Interactive board view: a regenerated HTML file and a phone-friendly README**<br>• board.html rendered with README on every write; a VS Code task opens it in the browser; collapsible README for the GitHub app | [`board-viewer`](design-board-viewer.md) | 5w<br>8d | board, ide, orch |
| F13 | L | **Weaver: a cold-start implementer beside Webster, with model escalation**<br>• A second implementer built on Millhouse Builder: a fresh agent per batch with its own model, escalating the model when an agent fails; Webster stays fork-based | [`weaver`](design-weaver.md) | 4w<br>7d | webster |
| F17 |  | **Ideas to borrow from comparable agent orchestrators (survey, Oct 2026)** | [`orchestrator-survey-ideas`](design-orchestrator-survey-ideas.md) | 3w<br>7d | burler, shed, orch, quarry, report |
